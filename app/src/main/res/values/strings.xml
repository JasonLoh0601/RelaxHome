        <item>Home Cleanz is founded in 2004 by 2 young graduates from the School of Design and Environment, National University of Singapore.
            We started out with a simple aim, which is to provide home cleaning services to busy professionals.
            Differentiating ourselves from the competition in the industry, we place particularly strong emphasis on our companyâ€™s service quality and after-sales service.
            We never stop learning to improve ourselves to serve our clients well. And because
            of this attitude throughout the company, we build strong and harmonious relationships with many customers.
            This is our thirteen year into our business, and we have not looked back since.
            We will continue to push ourselves to a greater height and always constantly innovate to excel in our business!</item>
        <item>Singapore is one of the few countries on the planet, Earth where its residents enjoy the pride of living an elegant life.
            Indeed, hundreds and thousands of homeowners achieve the beauty and elegance of their houses/homes/offices by employing different methods;
            which include keeping pets, flooring the house with beautiful tiles (and other kinds of flooring materials such as engineered wood flooring,
            laminate flooring, marble flooring, and so on), while others make their rooms nicer by covering the floors with amazingly good carpets, and many more.
            Nevertheless, this article dwells on carpets as well as ways of retaining its beauty. </item>
